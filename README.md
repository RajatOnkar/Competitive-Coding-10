Please submit the interview problems posted in slack channel here. The problems and statements are intentionally not shown here so that students are not able to see them in advance 

## Problem 1 - Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
# Initializa the first day stock price in a variable along with profit variable
# Iterate over the prices array and calculate the difference only when the stock price is greater than 
# previous price to gain profit
# Since we can buy the share again after selling it the profit can be cumulatively calculated
# Return the profit calculated else return the profit as '0'

## Problem 2 - Peeking Iterator
# Initializa the iterator and store the first element in result if the hasNext() returns a value
# Peek = Return the current element in result
# Next = Store the current element in a temp variable, if next element exists then return temp else None
# hasNext = Check if the next elements exists return 'True' else 'False'.
